# Python-Linear-Optimization



The Linear Optimization Problems Solver is a Python project that leverages the power of the `pulp` library to tackle six real-world linear optimization problems. 
Input data is prepared in an Excel spreadsheet format (.xlsx), following the specified structure outlined in the accompanying PDF file. 
By executing the `.py` script, the problems are efficiently solved, and the optimal solutions, objective values, and any pertinent details are displayed in the '.lp' files. 
This project offers a convenient and accessible approach to solving linear optimization problems using Python.
